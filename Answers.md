1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`. 

Server-side routing involves making a request to a server and then having the server retrieve the file and send the file
back to the client where the client renders the HTML/CSS. Each request causes a page refresh and needs to load each time a request is made. Now, with client-side routing, everything occurs in the browser and page refreshes are not needed for each request. 



2.  What does CRUD stand for?

     a. The Get request stands for the "R" in CRUD and stands for Read. It allows us to fetch and read data. The Post request is the "C" in CRUD and stands for Create. It allows us to create and insert new data into a datasource. The Put Request is the "UP in CRUD and stands for Update. It allows us to change data. The Delete is the "D" in CRUD and stands for Delete. 


3.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    Fetch, Axios, JQuery
